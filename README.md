# Word2Vec

The problem to be explored is Word2Vec, a natural
language processing technique. Word2Vec is used to learn
or generate word embeddings or associations from a given
text corpus. These associations or embeddings are able to
capture semantic relationships between words, resulting in
countless applications. Word2Vec models learn meaningful
relations between words and given contexts. This implementation of Word2Vec is written in python and was completed as a University assignment.
